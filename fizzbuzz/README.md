# FizzBuzz Code Kata

Fizz Buzz, according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a children's word game used to teach arithmetic division. The idea behind the game is for players to take turns replacing any number divisible by the number three with the word 'fizz' and numbers divisible by five with 'buzz'. In our derivation of the game, when a number is divisible by both three and five, the answer should be 'fizz buzz'.

You goal is to implement the fizz buzz game in the language of your choosing. However you choose to implement the game, you must provide tests to demonstrate it works by the game's rules. We strongly encourage a test-drive (or behavior-driven) approach as we find this helps to elicit the most straight forward implementation.
