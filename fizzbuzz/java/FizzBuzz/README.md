# FizzBuzz Java Implementation

This implementation of fizzbuzz was written in NetBeans IDE 7.3.1 against JDK 7u25. It uses one of the built-in unit test frameworks - JUnit.

If you do not have NetBeans IDE or JDK installed on your machine, you can download both from Oracle [http://www.oracle.com/us/downloads/index.html]. 

Once you have the project open in NetBeans, go to Run > Test Project.
