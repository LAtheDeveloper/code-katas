# FizzBuzz JavaScript Implementation

This implementation of fizzbuzz uses node version 0.10.15 and NPM version 1.3.5

If you do not have node installed on your machine, head over to [Nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your platform. Once installed, run `npm install` at the command line from the root of the JavaScript directory. 

This project depends on Mocha 1.12.0, a testing framework. Use the NodeJS package manager (npm) to install Mocha globally. Run npm install -g mocha.

After all dependencies are installed, run `npm test` in the project directory to run the unit tests.
