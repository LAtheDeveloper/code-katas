# FizzBuzz JavaScript Implementation

This implementation of fizzbuzz uses node version 0.10.15 and NPM version 1.3.5

If you do not have node installed on your machine, head over to [Nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your platform. Once installed, run `npm install` at the command line from the root of the JavaScript directory. After all of the dependencies are installed, run `npm test` to run the unit tests
