# FizzBuzz Ruby Implementation

This implementation of fizzbuzz uses ruby version 2.0, but any version later than 1.8 should be fine

If you are running a version of Ruby prior to 1.9, you will need to install the `minitest` ruby gem dependency. You can do this one of two ways. If you have the `bundler` gem installed, you can run `bundle` for the root of this project directory and all of the dependencies will be install for you. If don't have bundler installed, run `gem install minitest` from the command line.

To run the script, simply change into the directory containing this README file and type `ruby FizzBuzz.rb` at the command line and press enter.
