# FizzBuzz C# Implementation

This implementation of fizzbuzz was written in Visual Studio 2012 against .NET Framework 4.5. It uses NUnit, a third-party unit test dependency.

If you do not have Visual Studio installed on your machine, you can download Visual Studio Express 2012 from Microsoft [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/]. 

To install NUnit, download and install NuGet package manager. Open the FizzBuzz project. Right-click on References > Manage NuGet Packages. Search for NUnit and click Install. 

From Visual Studio main menu, navigate to Test > Run > All Tests.
